#### Scripts to calculate tissue-specificity metrics from gene expression data
<ol type="1">
  <li>R Code adopted from PMID: 26891983 (provided in supplementary materials).</li>
  <li>Calculated two tissue-specificity metrics (Tau and Preferential Expression Measure (PEM)) using the normalized TPM expression values by gene across tissues.</li>
  <li>The average gene expression across all replicates by tissue was used to compute Tau and PEM.</li>
  <li>Genes that were not expressed in at least one tissue were excluded from the analysis.</li>
